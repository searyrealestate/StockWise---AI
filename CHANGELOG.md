## Phase 1 — Bug Fixes

### Bug 1.2 — Column name case mismatch in `apply_checklist_bonus` (strategy_engine.py)

**Fixed:** Column lookups in `apply_checklist_bonus()` now match the lowercase snake_case names produced by `feature_engine.py`.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `SMA_50` | `sma_50` |
| `SMA_200` | `sma_200` |
| `rsi_14` | `rsi` |
| `BBU_20_2.0` (with `bb_upper` fallback) | `bb_upper` |

**Impact:** The checklist bonus was silently returning 0 for trend alignment, RSI momentum, and Bollinger Band distance checks because the keys never matched. With this fix, the bonus can now award up to +40 points as intended.
